# Foam for Sensepeek PCBite set

![CNC Cut foam for Sensepeek PCBite set](https://github.com/flummer/sensepeek-foam/raw/main/Images/foam_top.jpg "CNC Cut foam for Sensepeek PCBite set")

This is a design for CNC cut foam that fits in a plastic flightcase (specifically for an [EXTREME-300](https://flightcases.dk/cases/other-cases/extreme-300-case.html), but it can probably be tweaked to fit in other simialr cases).

## Design

The design is meant to be CNC cut in 30mm thick foam. I have used [PlastazoteÂ® LD29](https://www.zotefoams.com/product/azote/plastazote/), and that cuts pretty nice and is dense enough that you can actually take out a layer and move it around without stuff falling out.

The case I used has a total depth of 90 mm in the bottom part and have this egg crate style foam in the lid, so 3 layers of 30 mm fits nicely and you can keep some of the spares under the bottom layer.

The metal base plate also fits in the box, and I have put a thin sheet of EVA foam on the bottom of that.

## Instructions

There are two files (both in EPS and DXF), one with the design for the bottom and middle layer, and one for the top layer. The designs are identical, except for the outline, that is slightly smaller in the lower layers, as the box has slightly angled sides.

The [PDF guide](https://github.com/flummer/sensepeek-foam/raw/main/sensepeek_guide.pdf) shows how deep the different parts needs to be cut to fit the PCBite elements. All elements needs to be pocketed (except for the outline), and I think doing the outline first, and then the clearing ends up with the best result.

If cutting this with a laser cutter in thinner layers that are then glued together, simplifying the depths are probably the way to go.
